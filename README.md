TypeScript-Apollo based GraphQL API providing cannabis strain information &amp; ~vibes~

Currently, there are very few reliable sources for cannabis strain information. Those that exist are tailored towards driving traffic to a dispensary or seed company, rather than informing consumers about the profile and effects of a particular strain. This project aims to fill the market gap in consumer-targeted information as well as provide some fun stoner features.
